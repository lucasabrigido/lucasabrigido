Hi! I'm Lucas, a mobile and web developer with Javascript stack (React.js/React.ts, React Native and Node.js/Node.ts).
in my free time I venture with Python, Flask and Dart, Flutter.

I'm also a Computer Science student at Federal Institute of Science, Education and Technology from State of Ceará (IFCE).

One of my favorite activities is software development. I really like the idea that I can create something useful for people.
That's why I develop applications.

My favorite languages are:

- JavaScript, with the React.js and Node.js — I'm actually working with this.
- Python, with Flask - I'm actually working with this.

If you want know me better, my contact information is right above. Thanks for your attention!
